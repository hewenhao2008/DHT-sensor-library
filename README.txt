This is an library for Leaflabs's Maple. Library supports DHT series of low cost temperature/humidity sensors. 

Library is port of Adafruit's DHT library. A routine that works on maple was adopted
from another library which was also a fork of Adafruit's DHT library. Routines were
written by Chris Andreae. I also added initial support for Arduino Due.

Adafruit Industries published this originally under MIT license.
